            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).<br>
            CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

         <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-1-Inline CSS Method :-</font></h3>
            <a name="Question1"></a>

            <p>Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document. We can add CSS in three approaches: Inline, Internal, and External.<br>
                It has the interactive and unique style to create a single HTML element; we can define the inline CSS on the style attribute.</p>

        <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-2-Internal or Embedded CSS Method :-</font></h3>   
            <a name="Question2"></a> 

            <p>Internal CSS is a way of adding the CSS codes in the style element of head section of the document. <br> 
                All the changes done by the internal CSS can be applied only to a single web page. You can use internal CSS for one-page websites or projects where you do not want to use external CSS</p>

            <!----------------------------------Third question & answer---------------->
        <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-3-External CSS Method :- </font></h3>   
            <a name="Question3"></a>

            <p>External CSS contains separate CSS files that contain only style properties with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc). CSS property is written in a separate file with a .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using a link tag.<br>
                 It means that, for each element, style can be set only once and will be applied across web pages</p>

        <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-4-Origin of CSS3</font></h3>   
            <a name="Question4"></a>

            <p>The primary objective of HTML was to present information in a simple way which was actually intended for sharing scientific documents and research papers online. However, as the internet grew, HTML played a major role in web designing and was mainly used for the web presentation and multimedia. However, there were some formatting issues and as a result, CSS came into the play.<br>
                So, to enhance the presentation capabilities of HTML, World Wide Consortium’s introduced CSS. It had overcome the limitations of HTML and allowed designers to define the look and feel of the web pages by separating content from document's layout.<br>
                 CSS made it quite easy to specify various components of web pages such as font on the page, the size of the text, define columns, and formatting choices etc. It basically allows you to control the overall appearance of the web pages.</p>

            <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-5-Advantages of CSS:-</font></h3>   
                <a name="Question5"></a>

            <p>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for an element once & use it multiple times because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.
                The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across a variety of sites.<br>
                One instruction can control several areas which are advantageous.
                Web designers need to use a few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.<br>
                Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development but also simplifies maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole website and maintenance time.
                It is less complex therefore the effort is significantly reduced.
                It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.
                CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various range of smart devices to access websites over the web, there's a requirement for responsive web design.
                It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web elements that are there on the page.

            <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-6-Disadvantages of CSS:-</font></h3>   
            <a name="Question6"></a>

            <p>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating confusion among web browsers.<br>
                With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.
                There exists a scarcity of security.
                After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. A similar change affects all the browsers.
                The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. <br>Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.
                Browser compatibility (some style sheets are supported and some are not).<br>
                CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera support CSS as different logic.
                There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.
                There are multiple levels that create confusion for non-developers and beginners.</p>

            <a name="Question7"></a>

            <p>Inline CSS has the highest priority, then comes Internal/Embedded followed by External CSS which has the least priority. Multiple style sheets can be defined on one page.<br>
                 If for an HTML tag, styles are defined in multiple style sheets then the below order will be followed.<br>
                 As Inline has the highest priority, any styles that are defined in the internal and external style sheets are overridden by Inline styles.<br>
                Internal or Embedded stands second in the priority list and overrides the styles in the external style sheet.<br>
                External style sheets have the least priority. If there are no styles defined either in the inline or internal style sheet then external style sheet rules are applied for the HTML tags.</p>

            <a name="Question9"></a>

            <p>CSS Selectors: CSS Selectors are used to selecting HTML elements based on their element name, id, attributes, etc. It can select one or more elements simultaneously.<br>
               <Strong>Element selector:</Strong>The element selector in CSS is used to select HTML elements which are required to be styled. <br>
                In a selector declaration, there is the name of the HTML element, and the CSS properties which are to be applied to that element is written inside the brackets {}.<br>
                <strong>id selector: </strong>The #id selector is used to set the style of the given id. The id attribute is the unique identifier in an HTML document. The id selector is used with a # character.<br>
                <b>class selector:</b> The .class selector is used to select all elements which belong to a particular class attribute. To select the elements with a particular class, use the (.) character with specifying the class name.<br>
                 The class name is mostly used to set the CSS property to the given class.</p>

            <h3><font color="blue"></font-color>Answer-10-Margin and Padding :-</font></h3>   
            <a name="Question10"></a>

            <p>Margin is used to create space around elements and padding is used to create space around elements inside the border.
                We can set the margin property to auto but we cannot set the padding property to auto.<br>
                In Margin property we can allow negative or float number but in padding we cannot allow negative values.<br>
                Margin and padding target all the 4 sides of the element. Margin and padding will work without the border property also.<br>
                 The difference will be more clear with the following</p>
